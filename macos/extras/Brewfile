# May need to re-run `brew install vim` after installing Ruby with e.g. `asdf install ruby 2.6.5; asdf global ruby 2.6.5`, so it's compiled against the right Ruby.
# If https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/pull/575 is merged, try using that in the command above (to get latest Ruby without hard-coding a number into this file).
