# namelookup    - The time it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
# connect       - The time it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
# appconnect    - The time it took from the start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was completed.
# pretransfer   - The time it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
# redirect      - The time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final transaction was started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple redirections.
# starttransfer - The time it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
# total         - The total time that the full operation lasted.
# num_redirects - Number of redirects that were followed in the request.

# Examples:
#     curlt http://google.com/
#     curlt -H 'Cookie: foo=bar' 'http://google.com/'
